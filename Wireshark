To create a project using Wireshark to capture VOIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), you can follow these steps:

Download and install Wireshark on your computer. You can download it from the Wireshark website (https://www.wireshark.org/).

Open Wireshark and select the network interface that you want to capture traffic from. This is typically the network interface that is connected to the internet.

In the Wireshark interface, go to the Capture menu and select Options. This will open the Capture Options window.

In the Capture Options window, make sure that the correct network interface is selected and click the Start button to begin capturing traffic.

While Wireshark is capturing traffic, make a VOIP call using a VOIP service such as Skype or Google Voice.

Once the call is finished, stop the capture by going to the Capture menu and selecting Stop.

In the Wireshark interface, you should see a list of captured packets. You can use the filter bar at the top of the window to search for specific types of traffic, such as SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) or RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) packets.

You can also use the Decode As feature in Wireshark to decode the captured traffic as a specific protocol. This can make it easier to analyze the traffic and understand what is happening during the call.

Once you have captured and analyzed the traffic, you can create a report or presentation to document your findings and share your results with others. You can also use Wireshark to troubleshoot any issues you encounter during the call, such as poor call quality or connectivity problems.

Remember to always follow your organization's policies and procedures when using network monitoring tools like Wireshark. You may need to obtain permission from your network administrator before using Wireshark on your organization's network.
