To create a magic 8 ball using python, we can use the random module to generate a random number between 1 and 20, and then use that number to determine 
the response that the magic 8 ball will give. Here's what that might look like:



def magic_8_ball():
  # Generate a random number between 1 and 20
  num = random.randint(1, 20)

  # Use the random number to determine the response
  if num == 1:
    return "It is certain"
  elif num == 2:
    return "It is decidedly so"
  # Add more elif statements here to include all of the possible responses

  # If none of the above conditions are met, the magic 8 ball has no answer
  else:
    return "The magic 8 ball is unclear"
To use the magic 8 ball, we can call the magic_8_ball() function like this:

Copy code
response = magic_8_ball()
print(response)

This will generate a random response from the magic 8 ball and print it to the screen. 
You can extend this code to add more responses, or to include additional features, such as allowing the user to input a question for the magic 8 ball to answer.
