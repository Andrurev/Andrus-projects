ere is a sample automation script for cybersecurity that can be used to scan a network for vulnerabilities:


# Import the necessary modules
import os
import nmap

# Set the target IP range for the scan
ip_range = "192.168.1.1-254"

# Initialize the nmap scanner
scanner = nmap.PortScanner()

# Scan the network for open ports and vulnerabilities
scan_results = scanner.scan(ip_range, arguments="-sV -sC")

# Iterate over the hosts in the scan results
for host in scan_results["scan"]:
  ip = host[0]
  open_ports = host[1]["tcp"].keys()

  # Print the IP address and open ports for the current host
  print(f"Host: {ip}")
  print(f"Open ports: {open_ports}")

  # Check if the host has any vulnerabilities
  if "vulns" in host[1]:
    # If the host has vulnerabilities, print them
    vulns = host[1]["vulns"]
    print(f"Vulnerabilities: {vulns}")

# Print a message indicating that the scan is complete
print("Scan complete.")
This script uses the nmap module to scan a network for open ports and vulnerabilities. 
It then prints the IP address and open ports for each host in the network, as well as any vulnerabilities that were found. 
This script can be run from the command line using the python command, and can be extended to include additional features such as email notifications or automatic remediation of identified vulnerabilities.
