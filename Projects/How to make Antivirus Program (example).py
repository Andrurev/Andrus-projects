#First, you would need to import the necessary libraries, such as the os and hashlib modules, which provide functions for interacting with the operating system and generating cryptographic hashes, respectively.

# Next, you would need to define a function that can scan a file and calculate its cryptographic hash. This will allow you to compare the file's hash against a database of known malicious files to determine if it is potentially dangerous.

#Here is an example of a function that takes a file path and calculates its SHA-256 hash:

import hashlib

def scan_file(file_path):
    # Open the file in binary mode
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        # Calculate the SHA-256 hash of the file's contents
        file_hash = hashlib.sha256()
        file_data = f.read()
        file_hash.update(file_data)

    # Return the hexadecimal representation of the hash
    return file_hash.hexdigest()

  
#Next, you would need to create a database of known malicious files and their corresponding hashes. This could be done using a simple Python dictionary, where the keys are the hashes of the malicious files and the values are the file paths.

#For example:

malicious_files = {
    '5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592': '/path/to/malicious/file1.exe',
    '8f14e45fceea167a5a36dedd4bea2543': '/path/to/malicious/file2.exe',
    ...
}

# Once you have defined the scan_file function and created the database of known malicious files, you can use them to scan a directory for potentially dangerous files. This can be done by using the os.walk function to recursively iterate over all of the files in a directory and its subdirectories. For each file, you would use the scan_file function to calculate its hash, and then check if that hash exists in the database of known malicious files. If a match is found, you could alert the user and take appropriate action, such as deleting the malicious file.

# Here is an example of how this could be done:

import os

def scan_directory(directory):
    # Iterate over all files in the directory and its subdirectories
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            # Get the full path of the file
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)

            # Calculate the hash of the file
            file_hash = scan_file(file_path)

            # Check if the hash is in the database of known malicious files
            if file_hash in malicious_files:
                # Alert the user and take appropriate action
                print(f'Dangerous file detected: {file_path}')
                # TODO: Delete the malicious file
                
# Finally, you would need to call the scan_directory function and pass it the path of the directory you want to scan. For example:         
scan_directory('/path/to/directory')
