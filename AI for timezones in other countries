This code uses the datetime module in Python to get the current time in UTC (coordinated universal time), which is a standard time used as a reference across the world. It then defines a dictionary that maps country codes to time offsets, which represent the difference in hours between the local time in that country and UTC time.

The get_time_in_country() function takes a country code as input and uses the dictionary to look up the time offset for that country. It then adds the time offset to the UTC time to calculate the local time in that country and returns the result.

You can test the function by calling it with some example country codes and printing the result. The output will be the current time in the specified country. Keep in mind that this code is just a simple example and there are many details you may need to consider when creating a more sophisticated AI, such as handling daylight saving time, time zones, and different time formats.
